# Attention: It has been reported that the following methodology is no longer valid as it exports Starndard Notes in a new format. A pull request is needed to fix it.

## Usage:

```bash
python3 standard-notes-to-enex.py SN_Archive.txt
```
If a name like `SN_Archive.txt` is not provided, the script will assume your file is called `notes.txt`.
